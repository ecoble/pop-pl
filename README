This is the implementation of the Patient Oriented Programming Language (POP-PL)

The examples are the best documentation you get right now.

You can install this directly with "raco pkg install pop-pl"

Once installed you can now open and run any of the ".pop" files in the examples. Pressing run will present you with a REPL to play with message interactions.
